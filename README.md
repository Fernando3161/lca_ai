First version

you basically want a local-only LCA-proxy-model chatbot that reads your JSON data (converted from EcoSpold XML), works in a web-based interface, and runs with minimal resources on an 8 GB RAM machine.
. Decide the Architecture
Since you already have structured JSON, you can skip fine-tuning a model (too heavy for your setup) and instead use:

A local embedding model to vectorize your JSON content.

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, where your chatbot searches your data for relevant context before answering.

Advantages:
✅ No heavy training.
✅ Lightweight and runs on CPU.
✅ Easy to update by just re-indexing JSON.

2. Suggested Tech Stack
Core components:

Python (main language)

LangChain or LlamaIndex for RAG pipeline

SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or similar) for local embeddings

FAISS for vector storage

Gradio or Streamlit for a simple web interface

Lightweight local LLMs you can use:

llama.cpp with models like Mistral-7B or LLaMA 3 8B Instruct (quantized .gguf files to fit in RAM)

Or a smaller model like phi-3-mini if you need extreme speed.

3. Pipeline Overview
Load JSON → Extract "text" field (or structured fields) from each record.

Embed text with a local embedding model (sentence-transformers).

Store embeddings in FAISS.

User query → Embed query → Search FAISS for top N relevant chunks.

Pass retrieved context + query to a small local LLM.
