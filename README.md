First version

you basically want a local-only LCA-proxy-model chatbot that reads your JSON data (converted from EcoSpold XML), works in a web-based interface, and runs with minimal resources on an 8 GB RAM machine.
. Decide the Architecture
Since you already have structured JSON, you can skip fine-tuning a model (too heavy for your setup) and instead use:

A local embedding model to vectorize your JSON content.

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, where your chatbot searches your data for relevant context before answering.

Advantages:
✅ No heavy training.
✅ Lightweight and runs on CPU.
✅ Easy to update by just re-indexing JSON.

2. Suggested Tech Stack
Core components:

Python (main language)

LangChain or LlamaIndex for RAG pipeline

SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or similar) for local embeddings

FAISS for vector storage

Gradio or Streamlit for a simple web interface

Lightweight local LLMs you can use:

llama.cpp with models like Mistral-7B or LLaMA 3 8B Instruct (quantized .gguf files to fit in RAM)

Or a smaller model like phi-3-mini if you need extreme speed.

3. Pipeline Overview
Load JSON → Extract "text" field (or structured fields) from each record.

Embed text with a local embedding model (sentence-transformers).

Store embeddings in FAISS.

User query → Embed query → Search FAISS for top N relevant chunks.

Pass retrieved context + query to a small local LLM.

------------------- new process

Go to Ollama Downloads

Download and install the Windows installer (.exe).

Make sure “Add to PATH” is checked during install.

Update your NVIDIA GPU drivers from NVIDIA Drivers.

Restart your computer.

in command prompt

 ollama pull qwen3:0.6b


 1️⃣ Download and install Ollama
Go to: https://ollama.com/download

Download the Windows installer (.exe)

Run the installer and make sure to check “Add to PATH” during installation

Finish the installation

2️⃣ Update your NVIDIA GPU drivers
Visit https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx

Download and install the latest Game Ready or Studio drivers for your GPU

Restart your computer after installation

3️⃣ Verify GPU drivers and CUDA
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

powershell
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
nvidia-smi
You should see your GPU details and driver version

This confirms your GPU and CUDA drivers are installed and working

4️⃣ Open a new terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell)
Check Ollama is installed and accessible:

powershell
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
ollama --version
It should print the installed Ollama version

5️⃣ Download the model
Pull the qwen3:0.6b model (or any other available model):

powershell
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
ollama pull qwen3:0.6b
Wait for it to download — you’ll see progress messages

6️⃣ Verify downloaded models
List installed models:

powershell
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
ollama list
You should see qwen3:0.6b in the list

7️⃣ Run a quick test using GPU
Run the model and check if it uses GPU:

powershell
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
ollama run qwen3:0.6b
You should see output like:

markdown
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
Using GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX XXX
> 
Type a prompt, e.g., Hello! and press enter

The model should respond, confirming it’s running on GPU

8️⃣ Set up Python environment
Install required Python packages:

powershell
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
pip install ollama langchain sentence-transformers faiss-cpu gradio
(Optional) For GPU-accelerated embeddings, also install PyTorch with CUDA support:

powershell
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
9️⃣ Use the model in your Python chatbot
In your Python script, initialize Ollama LLM like this:
